Introduction
=============

As we use data from multiple sources, we will find them stored in many formats. One of the most 
common ways of storing data is in a database. In this chapter, we will use SQLlite to 
send queries to different databases, and import data from those databases into a pandas 
DataFrame. Then we will use the data to model different situations and predict outcomes.

Learning Goals and Objectives
-----------------------------

Learning goals:

- Manipulate data from a database using Structured Query Language.
- Use linear regression to model the relationship between predicted data and actual data.
- Create models that we can use to predict outcomes.  

Learning objectives:

- Import a SQL database into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Retrieve, sort, and aggregate data from a database.
- Join and extract data from multiple databases.
- Visualize data over a time series.
- Use a Linear Regression model to identify Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Error.
- Use the train-test split method to create and test models.
- Add features and use machine learning libraries to refine models and predictions.
