Glossary
========
**Optimization:** Optimization is a method in which some factors are either minimized or maximized based on a 
particular set of constraints.

**Objective function:** Objective funtion is the thing that you want to minimize or maximize depending on what 
is most suitable to the desired outcome. For example, you might want to maximize the total profit. 
Or, you might want to minimize the total cost.

**Constraints:** Constraints are the rules you must follow. 
For example, you can’t sell more things than you have. You can’t spend more money than you 
have in the bank. You can only make so many pizzas every hour.

**Independent Variable:** Is a variable that is not directly affected by another variable. It can affect 
the dependent variable.

**Dependent Variable:** Is a variable whose value is based on the change in a seperate variable. For example, 
the profits from the sale of Lemons depends on the price of Lemons.
