Introduction
============
Have you ever wondered how airline companies route their planes to minimize the 
costs for each trip and maximize the profit made from these trips? Or, how to 
minimize the waiting time for people in a customer service phone queue? These 
questions are examples of optimization problems.

Optimization is the overarching objective of Operations Research, the study of 
applying mathematics to business questions. Operations Research is closely related to Machine 
Learning and general Data Science as a subset of Applied Mathematics. It has 
many different uses, such as optimizing waiting lines (queue theory) or graph 
analysis (related to graph theory), but its most frequent use is Linear programming, 
a technique for solving systems of linear constraints with a linear objective function. 
You will learn about the optimization model and its three components: the objective 
function (the variable being optimized), the decision variables (those elements that 
will change to achieve the optimization), and the constraints (the elements that create limitations).

We will use a tool for linear programming called Solver in Google Sheets. Solver 
can also be used with Microsoft Excel and many other spreadsheet programs. 
 

Learning Goals
