Introduction
============
Have you ever wondered how airline companies route their planes to minimize the
costs for each trip and maximize the profit made from these trips? Or, how one might
minimize the waiting time for people in a customer service phone queue? These
questions are examples of optimization problems.

Optimization is the overarching objective of Operations Research, the study of
applying mathematics to these types of questions that are important in business
operations and in other areas where maximizing or minimizing something is important.
The field of Operations Research has
many different uses, such as optimizing waiting lines (queue theory) and graph
analysis (related to graph theory), but its most frequent use is in linear programming,
a technique for solving systems of linear constraints with a linear objective function.
In this chapter, you will learn about the optimization model and its three components: the objective
function (the variable being optimized), the decision variables (those elements that
will change to achieve the optimization),
and the constraints (the elements that create limitations).

We will use a tool for linear programming called Solver in Google Sheets. Solver
can also be used with Microsoft Excel and many other spreadsheet programs.
