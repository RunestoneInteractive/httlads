Introduction
============

In this chapter, we will explore the concepts of descriptive statistics and data types in statistics. We will also begin using Google Sheets to manipulate data to solve a business problem.  We will discuss the difference between correlation and causation and explain why correlation does not imply causation.

Learning Goals
--------------
- Know the difference between Statistics and Descriptive Statistical Analysis and be able to distinguish between the two types of Statistics: Descriptive and Inferential. 
- Compare and contrast central tendency, types of variability such as range, interquartile range, variance and standard deviation, modality, skewness, and kurtosis.
- Become familiar with basic spreadsheet operations such as:  addressing cells: relative versus absolute, on the same sheet versus across sheets: working with Ranges: ``SUM``, ``AVERAGE``, ``CORRELL``, tricks for copying and pasting down and across, ``VLOOKUP`` (match/index), grouping ``AVERAGEIF``, ``COUNTIF``, ``IF``, making a Pivot Table, cleaning ``TRIM`` and exploring ``UNIQUE``.

Learning Objectives
-------------------
- Know how to import, organize, and visualize data using Google Sheets.
- Extrapolate central tendencies and standard deviation of a given data set.
- Combine different datasets and use them to extract new data or compare/contrast their data with visuals such as graphs. 
- Be able to create and use pivot tables.

Time Required
-------------

This can easily take four class periods. But you can be less depending on how
much is done as homework versus in-class work.
