Introduction
=============

In this chapter, we will learn how retailers such as Amazon, eBay, and Instacart predict consumer 
shopping behavior and make suggestions accordingly. We will take a close look at the various methods 
used to find common patterns in consumer behavior and recommend items that the consumer is more likely 
to purchase. We will also explore tools such as recommender systems, which are a form of filtering systems 
that predict consumer’s preferences. We will learn how to use Python libraries to find common purchasing 
combinations and consumer’s purchasing preferences in a large data set.
