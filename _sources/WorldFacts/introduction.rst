Introduction
=============

This chapter will explore the concept of analyzing data sets to 
summarize their main characteristics and information. We will start by exploring
the dataset in more depth and use Pandas and Altair to explore and visualize the
data in different formats, such as histograms and maps. As we go further in
the chapter, you will realize that we do not have access to every data set in the form that we might wish. Often
we need to find other means to obtain the data we need or to reformat the data in some way. We will learn how to extract data from websites
using web scraping methods. Finally, you will be able to use the Pandas pivot table to summarize the data.


Learning Goals and Objectives
-----------------------------

Learning goals:

* Visualize, analyze, and describe data in various formats
* Extract data from different sources
* Summarizes the data of a large data set


Learning objectives:

* Use Pandas to analyze and describe data
* Visualize data with histograms and scatter plots
* Graph data on a map using web API
* Extract, clean, and save data from web documents


Reading List
------------

-  `One Dataset Visualized 25 Different Ways <https://flowingdata.com/2017/01/24/one-dataset-visualized-25-ways/>`_:
   This is a great article to help you think about visualization.
- `What is Exploratory Data Analysis <https://towardsdatascience.com/exploratory-data-analysis-8fc1cb20fd15>`_
-  `Getting Started with Altair <https://altair-viz.github.io/getting_started/starting.html>`_:
   Read the overview and then move to the
   `User Guide <https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/data.html>`_. Read this
   up to and including the section on data transformations.

In this first part of the module, we will continue with some data that should be familiar to you, but we
will use it in Pandas instead of a spreadsheet. In the second part, we will
focus on several different kinds of textual analysis using data. Download The `world countries <../_static/world_countries.csv>`_,
`protecting minority investors <../_static/protecting_minority_investors.csv>`_, and
`starting a business <../_static/starting_a_business.csv>`_ to get started. We
will be working with these files in this chapter. Keep in mind that this `starting a business <../_static/starting_a_business.csv>`_ is 
different than the one used in chapter 2.
