Introduction
=============


This chapter will explore the concept of text analysis and how it can be interpreted 
through visualizations. First, we will look at the data set and its components and then 
merge it to another data frame to have a more precise and accurate data frame. We will 
then discuss how we can use various methods with data frames to clean up our data for 
better analysis. We will then shift our focus to identifying and graphing relationships 
between multiple variables in a data frame. Finally, we will focus on evaluating and interpreting 
text to determine whether the text conveys a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. 


Learning Goals and Objectives
-----------------------------

Learning goals:

- Analyze and measure text complexity
- Find relationships in, and make a visual representation, from the text.
- Tidy up data to create a proper format for analysis
- Graph the relationship between different variables in a data set


Learning objectives:

- Reshape and merge one data frame to another to create a more precise and consistent data frame
- Apply the basic principles of tidying up data
- Measure text complexity using the Python package Textatistic
- Score and interpret various text using Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK)
