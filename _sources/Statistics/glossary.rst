**Correlation Matrix:** Is a table used to show the correlation between different variables in each cell.

**Correlation:** Is a relationship between two or more things.

**Data analysis:** Is the process in which data is inspected, cleansed, transformed, and modeled to discover useful information, conclusions, and supporting decision-making.

**Google Sheets:** Is a spreadsheet application that allows users to manipulate data.

**Histogram:** Is a graph used to display data.

**Mean:** is the average of a set of values.

**Median:** is the middle value of the dataset. 

**Mode:** is the most common value on the dataset and shows frequency.

**Pearson correlation:** Is a type of measurement; it measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. -1 has a strong negative relationship, and +1 has a strong positive relationship.

**Pivot table:** Is a function used in Google Sheets to summarize, organize, sort, and perform other operations on data sets.

**Range:** is the difference between the lowest and highest values of the dataset.

**Standard Deviation:** Is used to measure the degree of variation of a set of values. It also shows the difference from the mean and how spread out the data is more than other types of variabilities.

``INDEX`` Returns the content of a cell, specified by row and column offset.

``MATCH`` The MATCH function allows us to search for a value in a range of cells and return the position of that value

``MAXIFS`` In Google sheets, it is a function that returns the maximum value in a range of cells that meet specific conditions.

``MEDIAN`` Will determine the middle value in a numeric dataset.

``MINIFS`` A function used in Google Sheets that returns the smallest value that meets a specific criteria

``MIN`` Will return the minimum value in a numeric dataset

``MODE`` Will look for and return the most commonly occurring value in a dataset.

``STDEV`` Calculates the standard deviation.

``SUM`` This function returns the sum of a series of numbers.

``SUMIF`` Uses a conditional sum across a range and returns it.

``TRIM`` is used to remove repeated spaces in the text.

``UNIQUE`` Returns unique and discarding duplicate rows in a specific range. Unique returns the row in which the unique value first appears.

``VLOOKUP`` Is a function used in Google Sheets to extract and return a value from a table based on a specific condition.
