Introduction
============

Data scientists have to deal with a lot of data at once. While Google Sheets 
and Excel are great ways to visualize and manipulate data, they are not as versatile 
as we might want. That is where **data frames** come in. In this chapter, you will be introduced 
to data frames and learn to use them to obtain information from data.
