Introduction
============

Data scientists have to deal with a lot of data at once. While Google Sheets 
and Excel are great ways to visualize and manipulate data, they are not as versatile 
as we might want. That is where **data frames** come in. In this chapter, you will be introduced 
to data frames and learn to use them to obtain information from data. 

Learning Goals
---------------
- Learn how to create and manipulate a ``DataFrame``.
- Learn how to use data from multiple ``DataFrames``.

Learning Objectives
--------------------
- Be able to use Jupyter Notebooks and Pandas.
- Be able to import data into a ``DataFrame``.
- Be able to manipulate ``DataFrames`` to gain specific information.
