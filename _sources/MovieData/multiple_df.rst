Dealing With Multiple DataFrames
================================

Forget about budget or runtimes as criteria for selecting a movie, let's take a
look at popular opinion. Our dataset has two relevant columns: ``vote_average``
and ``vote_count``.

Let's create a variable called ``df_high_rated`` that only contains movies that
have received more than 20 votes, and whose average score is greater than 8.

.. jupyter-execute::

   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv("https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/bnmnetp/httlads/master/Data/movies_metadata.csv").dropna(axis=1, how='all')

   df_highly_voted = df[df.vote_count > 20]
   df_high_rated = df_highly_voted[df_highly_voted.vote_average > 8]
   df_high_rated[['title', 'vote_average', 'vote_count']].head()



Here we have some high-quality movies, at least according to some people.


.. fillintheblank:: mov_highly_rated

   How many highly-rated movies are in this dataset? |blank|

   - :178: Is the correct answer

But what about **my** opinion?

Here are my favorite movies and their relative scores. Create a DataFrame called
``compare_votes`` that contains the title as an index and both the
``vote_average`` and ``my_vote`` as its columns. Also, only keep the movies that
are both my favorites and popular favorites.

**Hint:** You'll need to create two Series, one for my ratings and one that maps
titles to vote_average.


.. jupyter-execute::

   my_votes = {
       "Star Wars": 9,
       "Paris is Burning": 8,
       "Dead Poets Society": 7,
       "The Empire Strikes Back": 9.5,
       "The Shining": 8,
       "Return of the Jedi": 8,
       "1941": 8,
       "Forrest Gump": 7.5,
   }


There should be only 6 movies remaining.

Now add a column to ``compare_votes`` that measures the percentage difference
between the popular rating and my rating for each movie. You'll need to take the
difference between the ``vote_average`` and ``my_vote`` and divide it by
``my_vote``.


.. code:: python3

   compare_votes


.. fillintheblank:: mov_star_wars_difference

   What's the percentage difference between the popular rating for Star Wars and my vote
   for it? |blank|

   - :-10: Is the correct answer
     :10: Make sure you use the popular rating minus my rating
     :-0.10: Make sure you convert your answer to a percentage
