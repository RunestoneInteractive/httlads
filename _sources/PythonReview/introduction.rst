Introduction
============

As you might expect, data science typically uses more tools than
the spreadsheet.
In later chapters, you will learn how to use data frames, databases,
screen scraping, data visualization, and other concepts and tools essential to
data scientists. Before you can learn these, however, you must have a rudimentary
understanding of a programming language. In this chapter, you will get an introduction
to Python.  Python is powerful, easy to learn, and one of the most-used programming
languages in the data science field. You will also set up the tools you will be
using throughout the entire course including a type of scientific notebook that
allows for a mix of text and code.
