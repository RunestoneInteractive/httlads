# How to Think Like a Data Scientist

## Before you Clone this Repository install git-lfs

There are a number of large data files in this book.  You need to enable git-lfs or when you clone you will just get stubs of the data files and things will break all over the place.

## Before you build install the packages in requirements.txt

This book also uses a number of additional packages that the regular runestone command does not include.  Please update your virtual environment.


This is a project based course to get you to think like a data scientist, teach you some of the tools of a data scientist and generally improve your problem solving skills.

Course Outputs Learning Objectives

## Course Outline

### [Week 1-2] --  Module 1

* Spreadsheets. Ex: Environmental studies, weather, happiness * data on countries
    * Descriptive statistics
	* Charts: Scatter plots, box plots, line plots, histograms

* Using functions, including vlookup 
* Optimization using Solver

		

### [Weeks 3-4] --  Module 2

Review of Frequency Analysis for Textual Data. Data from United Nation dataset.

* Brainstorming/Generating questions: What were hot topics? What topics are common?
* Using Word Cloud & textatistic library in Python
* Using Web APIs 
* Join two datasets 

End-of-Module Exercise: Pick your favorite out-of-copyright data repository, and analyze character references.  Project Gutenberg.

* Module Intro (1 day) 
    * Loading files
    * This will be good review for python usage, e.g. reading files, working with dictionaries, etc.
    * Give an example of a question on something simple: what were important topics discussed in 1970? 
    * From this dataset, ask students what other questions would they want to explore, jot down on the board.  Add seeded questions to the board (from facilitator guide).
    * Segue into answering student-driven questions using Pandas; framing Pandas as a way to address pain felt earlier

* Pandas Intro
    * Prework: Watch Tutorials to get intro to Pandas:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JnMutdy6Fw 
    * Data Exploration Exercise #1 (Do this, what happened?, modify it, repeat):
    * Load data into data frame
    * Use filtering to see only the data from 1970)
    * see only data from 1970 from U.S.
    * Group By Year
    * Group By Country
    * Answer one of the questions you generated above, using some of the things you just learned/explored.

* Data Exploration #2: Quantify Text Data using 
    * Use wordcloud to create a visual, introduce that it’s minor data cleaning (removes ‘and’, ‘the’)
    * Use textatistic to assign a number to each row (add a column to your dataset)
    * Instructor-led debrief to review solution(s) and relay tips
    * Plot the complexity calculated

* Screen Scrape CIA data
    * CIA data is available online but not very convenient.  The CSV file we have is from 2006 so is quite outdated.  We would like to update this data.
    * Tutorial using requests python module
    * https://towardsdatascience.com/data-analytics-with-python-by-web-scraping-illustration-with-cia-world-factbook-abbdaa687a84

* Data Exploration #3: 
    * Add continent, region, GDP, life expectancy to our dataset
    * Create a simple visualization using newly added data (e.g. showing each country on the map with life expectancy)
    * Save the dataset by exporting to CSV so that you don't have to pull the data again

### [Weeks 5-6] Module 3

* Review of Frequency Analysis for Numeric Data. A numeric-based exercise from say DataUSA, pop culture (movie gross?)
	* Brainstorming/Generating questions: What were hot topics? What topics  are common?
	* Reading CSV/JSON
	* Handle missing data
	* Normalize the data
	* Correlation
	* Regression or classification
	* Exercise: TBD

### [Week 7-8]  Midterm Project Weeks  

Work in pairs, choose your dataset
In-class work on projects -- practice applying concepts from modules above

### [Week 8-9]  Module 4

Predictive -- simple recommender system. Ex: Insta-cart shopping basket recommendation; MovieLens data;  beer & diapers story; movies/music/books.
* Correlation
* Pull in Heat maps
* SQL basics
* Bias

### [Week 10-11] Module 5  

* Time Series/Historical Data Analysis.  Ex: Hamburger prices
    * Currency converting
    * Histograms
    * Sampling
    * Hypothesis testing

### [Week 12, Holiday Break, TBD & movable] Fun Model + Choosing Visualizations

* Simulation -- Monte Hall -- 3 Doors, Prize
* Choosing between chart types for reports
* Dice or Roulette simulation
* Extra alternatives: Cohort Analysis

### [Week 13-14]  Final Project & Presentation Week

Work in pairs, choose your dataset
Presentations (possibly a poster fair) & feedback
